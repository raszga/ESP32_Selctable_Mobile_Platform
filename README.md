	An application to ESP32 udp wifi protocol using a wifi Joystick acting also as access point.
	The folder configuration contains in the library folder also the ESP32Mobile (.cpp, .h) which are the common files to be used by different platform configurations.
	The Joystick uses also an ESP32 to read 5 analog inputs and buttons and pack them in a comma separated string and broadcast them to the receivers (server).
